# Kubernetes Contributor Playground for United Kingdom

Hello new contributors!

This repository will be used as a safe space for participants in the New Contributor Onboarding Track to familiarize themselves with (some of) the Kubernetes Project's review and pull request processes.

To get started, create a new markdown (.md) file, named `<Your-GitHub-Username>.md` under `/united-kingdom/contributors` directory.

Please refer docs in each subfolder for community, discussion, contribution, support, and code of conduct.
