Hello Kubernetes Community,

My name is Anvesh and I am excited to start contributing to Kubernetes. I have been working with Kubernetes in a professional setting for a while now and I am eager to give back to the community that has helped me so much.

I have experience in software development, particularly in Python & Golang. I am comfortable with the Linux environment and have a good understanding of containerization and orchestration concepts.

I am looking forward to learning from everyone in the community and making meaningful contributions to the project. Please let me know how I can get started or if there are any issues that would be good for a newcomer like me.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best,
Anvesh
