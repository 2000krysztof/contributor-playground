# Hello, Kubernetes Community! 👋

## Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Yashwanth Mannem. I'm a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and currently working on multi-cluster Kubernetes platforms using Cluster API. I'm thrilled to be part of this amazing community.


## My Goals 🎯

- **Active Contribution**: I aspire to become an active contributor to the Cluster API project, and other initiatives within the Kubernetes ecosystem.
  
- **Learning**: The Kubernetes landscape is vast, and there's always something new to learn. My journey doesn't stop at being a CKA; it's just the beginning.
  
- **Mentorship**: I'm not only interested in contributing to the codebase but also in helping newcomers find their way around Kubernetes.

## What I'm Working On 🛠️

- **Multi-Cluster Management**: Managing resources effectively across multiple clusters.
  
- **Cluster API**: Working on implementing custom solutions using Cluster API.
  
## Let's Connect 🤝

I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and mentor from each of you.
