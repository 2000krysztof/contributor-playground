## Hello K8s community

I'm planning to actively self-study and contribute to areas of interest as I learn more about k8s

Here is an amazing quote recorded at the FIFA World Cup final 2022-12-18

### Peter Drury on Messi
```
He was beautiful...  
He was the point of difference,  
He has always been... the point of difference  
Unparalleled...  
And maybe today there will  
Ofcourse always be those who argue  
Always be those who debate...
And the debate can rage on if you like  
But as he falls in love...  
With the object in the world that his heart most desired...  
It is hard to escape the supposition  
That he has rendered himself today...  
The greatest of all time...
```
