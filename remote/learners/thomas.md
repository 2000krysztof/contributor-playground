Hello k8s learner community,

I'm Thomas, a software engineer from Vietnam. This is my first attempt to contribute to an open source project.

Although I'm still very far behind in terms of knowledge and experience, I'm willing to learn and improve myself however I can. I hope that one day
I can look back to this file and be glad that I took that first step.

Good luck to those who are just like me, struggling with this industry, but nevertheless doing what they can to improve.

Cheers,
Thomas
